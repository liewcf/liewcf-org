  A simple checklist I use to keep small projects moving without overengineering.

Every project starts as a small idea. I try to keep the first version narrow: define the goal, pick the simplest tools, and ship something useful fast.

## The checklist

- Write down the one-line outcome.
- Remove anything that doesn’t serve it.
- Build the smallest version worth sharing.

That mindset keeps my WordPress tools and browser extensions lightweight and easy to maintain.
